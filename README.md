## Errors
The actions you can access in the API are dependent upon the permission levels assigned to your account. If you find yourself receiving "message": "Unauthenticated."" | Status: <i>401 Unauthorized</i>, please confirm your permission level.

If you find a typo or an error, please send a pull request. You can also submit an issue (which will require a GitHub account) and I will look into it.
